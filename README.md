# Carpe Acta

Carpe Acta is an anti-procrastination web app built around practical tips, small quests, and repeatable daily action.

The first version focuses on a small, useful loop:

- show a featured daily quest
- generate a random anti-procrastination tip
- browse tips by category
- keep the content data-driven so the app can grow without rewrites

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Plain CSS with design tokens

This keeps the first version lightweight while leaving room for later features such as favorites, search, streaks, Pomodoro sessions, XP, achievements, and RPG progression.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the local development server
- `npm run build` - type-check and build the app
- `npm run preview` - preview the production build locally
- `npm test` - check tip content integrity, localization, and selection behavior

## Project Shape

```text
src/
  components/   Reusable React UI components
  data/         Static app content for the MVP
  types/        Shared TypeScript domain types
  utils/        Pure helper functions
```

## Adding a bilingual tip

1. Add metadata to `src/data/tips.ts`: a unique, stable `id`, an existing
   `categoryId`, positive `effortMinutes`, and `tags` (use `[]` until tags are
   curated). Effort estimates the immediate action, not the whole project.
   Preserve existing IDs and ordering; order affects daily quests and previews.
2. Add the same ID to both `src/i18n/tips/en.ts` and
   `src/i18n/tips/sr-Latn.ts`, with nonempty `title`, `text`, and `action`.
   `whyItWorks` is optional; add it only when reviewed content exists. It is not
   displayed yet. Keep tags language-independent and consistently lowercase.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`, then check both languages in the app.

`TipId` is derived from the metadata catalog. TypeScript requires every tip in
both translation maps; there is no separate ID list to maintain. Base metadata
types live in `src/types/tipMetadata.ts` so they do not depend on the catalog.
Interface copy remains in `src/i18n/messages.ts`; `src/i18n/localizeTip.ts`
combines it with tip translations for display. Completion records reference tip IDs
instead of becoming fields on shared content; future favorites should do the same.

## Action completion

The random tip card's “I did it” button records the suggested immediate action,
not completion of the user's larger task. Each displayed action can be completed
once. Generating another tip or selecting a category starts a fresh attempt,
even if a single-tip category returns the same tip. Switching language preserves
the current completion state. Reloading starts a fresh attempt and retains history.

History is stored only in this browser under `carpe-acta-completions-v1` as an
array of `{ id, tipId, completedAt }` records, with unique completion IDs and ISO
timestamps. There is no history screen or account sync yet. Blocked storage,
invalid stored data, or a failed write leaves existing data untouched and shows
that the completion could not be saved. The current card still acknowledges it.
