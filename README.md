# Carpe Acta

Carpe Acta is an anti-procrastination web app built around practical tips, small quests, and repeatable daily action.

The first version focuses on a small, useful loop:

- show a featured daily quest
- generate a random anti-procrastination tip
- browse tips by category
- keep the content data-driven so the app can grow without rewrites

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Plain CSS with design tokens

This keeps the first version lightweight while leaving room for later features such as favorites, search, streaks, Pomodoro sessions, XP, achievements, and RPG progression.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the local development server
